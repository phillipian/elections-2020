      <h3 class="article-title">Andover Seniors Vote in 2020 U.S. Presidential Election</h3>
      <h4 class="article-credit"><a href="https://phillipian.net/author/karenwang/">By Karen Wang</a></h4>
      <p class="article-body">Voting in the 2020 U.S. Presidential election is looking different than most years: some voters line the streets, wear masks, and practice social distancing, while others fill out mail-in ballots in record numbers. For
        certain eligible Andover students, many are doing the same.<br><br>

        According to a recent survey sent by <i>The Phillipian</i> to all students and faculty, which 65.1 percent of the total student body responded to, 9.8 percent are eligible to vote, 82.7 percent of which are registered to vote. Some students have
        already voted in their hometowns while others plan to vote remotely or at the local Andover voting station. Some students have seen this election as particularly contentious among the student body.<br><br>

        “Andover’s political climate is predominantly liberal, but this election has raised conservative voices in the student body as well. I’ve seen political and social views be pretty polarizing and divisive in terms of friendships and dorm
        cultures, in classroom settings, and on sports teams. My pod actually hung up a banner that criticized Trump and we were asked to take it down so as not to offend anyone,” wrote Emma Kaplon ’21 in an email to <i>The Phillipian</i>.<br><br>

        According to Kaplon, voting is the most fundamental civic duty. She believes that each person is responsible for deciding who they think will best represent, protect, and advocate for their own rights and interests in addition to those of their
        fellow citizens.<br><br>

        “The voting process was so exciting. I pre-registered really early, so I got my absentee ballot just a week or so after my birthday in October. I make a concerted effort to stay informed with regard to politics, current events, and the social
        climate, and I knew long before I actually checked the box that I would be voting for Biden and Harris. I spent a lot of time in the days between getting my ballot and mailing it in researching the California propositions, so that I would be
        making well-informed decisions on the state level as well,” wrote Kaplon.<br><br>

        She continued, “In the United States, we have a rare opportunity to elect the people who represent our nation; to forgo that opportunity is to choose not to contribute or support the wider community. Voting is one of the few ways that people
        are able to make a concrete difference in the political climate and to have their voices heard as they fight against injustices. Every vote matters.”<br><br>

        Lilly Yager ’21 filled out her mail-in registration sheet after she turned 18 over the summer. When she mailed it in, she did not get a notification and was told she was not eligible to vote in the election. She then found that her address was
        incorrect, but she sorted out the situation and was able to vote. According to Yager, she learned that she cannot leave mail-in voting to the mail system. Yager also stressed her belief in the importance of down ballot and local elections.<br><br>

        “Voting is important because it determines our future, it determines where we head as a country, it determines why we work every day. The person at the top is important, but I really think it’s local elections that matter the most. Local
        elections really will determine what happens close to home and they’re the ones that advocate for you in your area, district, or state. I really value local elections, but I do think it’s important to have a strong figure at the presidential
        level as well,” said Yager.<br><br>

        Kate Pfister ’21 had a difficult experience choosing where to vote due to her dual-residency in Connecticut and Maine. Since Maine is historically more Republican than Connecticut, Pfister believes her vote for Biden/Harris will have more of an
        impact. In the end, Pfister chose Maine, and expressed her opinion on why she voted for Biden/Harris.<br><br>

        “I think a third-party vote is a waste because the goal of this election NEEDS to be getting Trump out of office. Settling for Biden is the best option. Every vote is important, especially in swing states. It can be a pain, like my parents and
        I had to do a lot of coordinating to figure out registration, but everyone needs to have confidence that their vote matters, now more than ever before,” wrote Pfister in an email to <i>The Phillipian</i>.<br><br>

        Aidan Pretti ’21 has a different view from Pfister on third-party votes. He believes that voting third-party has important symbolic value in challenging the two dominant American political parties. While Pretti is only 17 years old and thus
        ineligible to vote in 2020, he supports Jo Jorgensen from the Libertarian party since his view aligns most closely to the Libertarian ideology surrounding economy and gun rights.<br><br>

        “[The Democratic and Republican Parties] are so powerful that people just assume that the two-party power dynamic can never actually be disrupted. I think it’s important to choose the lesser of two evils, but it’s also important to note that
        the two-party system could be disrupted in one election cycle. The two parties have so much power and influence, they’ve convinced people to be scared of the other party option to vote for the third party,” said Pretti.<br><br>

        According to Carolina Weatherall ’21, who voted for Biden/Harris, the 2020 election represents an existential threat to her generation’s climate, mental and physical health, marriage equality, and simple physical safety. She found her voting
        experience to be extremely fun and very simple.<br><br>

        “I am living at home this term, so I was able to vote in person at my local town hall. It was surreal to walk into that space and fill out a ballot, and what a year to do it!” wrote Weatherall in an email to <i>The Phillipian</i>.<br><br>

        She continued, “Generally, I find many students are either quite vocal (on social media spaces in particular) or not vocal at all. Rarely is there an in-between. Yet there is a certain tendency to make a statement (online or in person) that
        pertains to the majority opinion but takes little action to support or further that statement. As for interactions between students and faculty, I find that this community is comfortable discussing politics in an open and healthy way. In other
        spaces (schools I mean) faculty are not permitted to express a [political] opinion – I find that very counterintuitive!”</p>

      <span><a href="https://phillipian.net/2020/10/30/counterpoint-column-the-electoral-college/" class="read">Read More</a></span>
      <p>Alex Mitchell ’22 and Sophie Glaser ’22 debate the importance of the electoral college, an issue that has been subject to much political discourse within the past few months.</p>
      <article>
        <p>According to Mitchell, “The authors of the Constitution sought to create a system in which every citizen’s vote mattered to those running for office: the electoral college accomplishes this in ways that a simple popular vote system never could. If only the popular vote mattered, urban citizens would control elections because of their far greater numbers. A system in which the citizens of our biggest cities controlled elections, where no one else’s votes mattered, would give urban voters a monopoly on political attention. Campaigns would likely never visit states with smaller populations, and thus those states’ interests would go ignored.”</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <p>Glaser wrote, “Democracy: a term closely associated with the United States, a word repeated in speeches by presidential candidates, critics, and politicians alike, a word that inspires ideas of liberty, freedom, and the American way. Federal elections are considered to be pillars of this idea of democracy, but they do not live up to this narrative. Our elections do not represent the people of the United States and the will of American citizens due to an outdated remnant of the past that serves only to impede representation in government: the electoral college.”</p>

        Myra Bhathena ’22 reflects on her experience of phone-banking a Trump supporter and discusses the importance of having empathy during political discussions especially in today’s political climate. Connecting the broader issue of polarity to conversations held in Andover, Bhathena also elaborates the tools and resources Andover students can better take advantage of to help interrogate the ideologies of others and also their own. The only way to bridge the gap between “The Left” and “The Right,” we must disregard our preconceived notions about certain parties and address one another with humanity and respect.

        While “misinformation” is an inaccurate interpretation of information that may result from a lack of knowledge, “disinformation” is false information spread with the intent to confuse or deceive, often contradicting information that has already been proven.
